```javascript
// ... some Tailwind CSS classes ...
<div class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Unexpected Behavior</h2>
  <p>This component is not displaying as expected. The background color is incorrect, and the shadow is not visible. The text color appears to be inherited from a parent element, but it should be set explicitly by Tailwind CSS.</p>
</div>
